{"name":"Network centrality","tagline":"A tutorial on using Python to visualise a city network and to calculate the eigenvector centrality using a random walk.","body":"This is a tutorial using Python. It was created by Alex Rutherford in 2013 to be used as teaching materials for a Masters level course in data science.\r\nA network of flight connections between global cities is considered. Using a random walk on the network, the eigenvector centrality of the network is calculated.\r\nThe following modules and concepts are introduced; power iteration, eignvector centrality, pickle, matplotlib and NumPy.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
